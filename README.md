# PG-Life

This project is a web-based platform that helps users find the nearest paying guest (PG) accommodations. Using location-based services, the website displays available PGs in the user's vicinity, along with key details such as price, amenities, and contact information. The interface allows users to search, filter, and sort results based on their preferences, ensuring they can easily find accommodations that suit their needs. It provides a convenient solution for individuals seeking nearby PG options with minimal effort.
